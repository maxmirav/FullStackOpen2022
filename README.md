# FullStackOpen2022
A repository for exercises from the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open 2022 course. These are exercises related to building modern Javascript single page apps with ReactJS that use REST APIs with a NodeJS backend. Other technologies I've studied in this course aside from React include Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and Typescript.
